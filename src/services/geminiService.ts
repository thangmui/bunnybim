Analyze the two images provided. The first image contains a subject (e.g., a person, an animal). The second image contains a product (e.g., clothing, an object). Your task is to create a single, new, hyperrealistic photograph that seamlessly combines them in a logical and natural way.

Core Logic:
- If the product is wearable, the subject must be wearing it correctly.
- If the product is an object, the subject should be holding, using, or interacting with it appropriately.
- The final composition must look like a single, professionally shot photograph.

Crucial Constraints & Enhancements:
1.  Preserve Product Integrity: The product from the second image MUST be rendered with 100% accuracy. Do not change its shape, color, texture, details, patterns, or any branding. It must be perfectly recognizable.
2.  Preserve Subject Integrity: The subject from the first image must remain identical. DO NOT alter their facial features, body shape, or defining characteristics.
3.  Hyperrealism & Quality: The output must be an ultra-realistic, professional-grade photograph. Pay extreme attention to matching lighting, shadows, perspective, and scale. The final image must be exceptionally sharp, crisp, high-resolution, and completely free of any digital artifacts or noise.

You are a world-class visual effects and compositing artist. Your task is to analyze two images, each with a person, and create a single, new, hyperrealistic photograph that seamlessly integrates both individuals into a shared, photorealistic scene. The final image must be indistinguishable from a real photograph shot with a high-end camera.

User's Creative Direction:
- The primary creative guidance for the scene, mood, and activity comes from this user prompt: "${prompt}"

Core Objective:
- Place both individuals in the scene described by the user.
- Position them naturally, as if they are interacting or posing together in the same physical space.

Technical & Artistic Integration Mandates (Non-negotiable):
1.  Identity Preservation (100% Accuracy): Both individuals MUST remain identical to their source photos. Do not alter their facial features, body shape, hair, or unique characteristics. They must be perfectly recognizable.
2.  Unified Lighting & Shadow: You MUST establish a single, consistent light source for the entire scene. The lighting (highlights, midtones, shadows) on both individuals must perfectly match each other and the environment. All shadows must be cast from this single light source with matching direction, softness, and intensity. There should be no conflicting lighting cues.
3.  Seamless Color Grading: Apply a uniform color grade across the entire final image. The color temperature, saturation, and contrast on both people must be identical and perfectly blended with the background's color palette.
4.  Cohesive Atmosphere & Depth: Ensure both individuals share the same atmospheric perspective (e.g., haze, fog) and depth of field. If the background is blurred, the focus on both subjects must be consistent.
5.  Perfect Perspective & Scale: The perspective, scale, and eye-lines of both individuals must be perfectly aligned with each other and the environment, creating a believable and coherent 3D space.
6.  Photographic Quality: The final output must be an ultra-realistic, professional-grade photograph. It must be exceptionally sharp, high-resolution, and completely free of digital artifacts, noise, or any signs of manipulation.

4.  Background: Replace the background with a solid, professional studio backdrop, preferably a dark navy blue or a neutral grey. Add a very subtle vignette.
5.  Retouching: Perform light, natural skin retouching. Smooth the skin slightly but retain texture. Reduce temporary blemishes. Brighten eyes and teeth subtly.
6.  Overall Quality: The final image must be ultra-sharp, high-resolution, and look like it was shot with a professional camera like a Canon EOS R5 with a 50mm lens. Enhance micro-contrast and color for a rich, true-to-life look. Do not over-process.`;

2.  Enhance Details: Increase the sharpness and clarity of the image. Bring out fine details in faces, clothing, and the background that have been lost over time. Do not over-sharpen.
3.  Colorize (if B&W): If the photo is black and white or sepia, apply natural, realistic, and historically appropriate colors. Skin tones should be lifelike, and colors for clothing and environment should be plausible for the era.
4.  Correct Tones: Adjust brightness, contrast, and levels to create a balanced and vibrant image. Fix any fading or yellowing.
5.  Noise Reduction: Gently reduce film grain and noise, but preserve the natural texture of the photograph. Avoid an overly smooth or "plastic" look.

Crucial Constraints:
-   Preserve Identity: DO NOT alter the facial features, expressions, or identities of the people in the photo.
-   Maintain Composition: Keep the original composition and framing of the photograph.
-   Authenticity: The final result should look like a well-preserved photograph from its original era, not a modern digital creation. The goal is restoration, not modernization.
